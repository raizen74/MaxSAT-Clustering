# MaxSAT-Clustering
Coded a Python implementation of the method described in the paper published in 2013 by Jeremias Berg and Matti JÃ¤rvisalo [Optimal Correlation Clustering via MaxSAT](https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/mjarvisa/papers/berg-jarvisalo.icdmw13.pdf). I performed the encoding of this NP-HARD problem implementing the HARD and SOFT clauses described in the paper and I transformed the correlation matrix into boolean constraints to obtain a Maximum SATisfiability resulting clustering. After obtaining the OPTIMAL resulting clustering, I extract which SOFT clauses are violated from the model.
