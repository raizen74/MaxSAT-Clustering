# MaxSAT-Clustering
Coded a Python implementation of the method described in the paper published in 2013 [Optimal Correlation Clustering via MaxSAT](https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/mjarvisa/papers/berg-jarvisalo.icdmw13.pdf) published by Jeremias Berg and Matti JÃ¤rvisalo. I performed the encoding of this NP-HARD problem implementing the HARD and SOFT clauses described in the paper and I transformed the correlation matrix into boolean constraints to obtain a Maximum satisfiability resulting clustering. After obtaining the OPTIMAL resulting clustering, I check which SOFT clauses are violated.
