# MaxSAT-Clustering
Coded a Python implementation of the method described in the paper published in 2013 by Jeremias Berg and Matti JÃ¤rvisalo [Optimal Correlation Clustering via MaxSAT](https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/mjarvisa/papers/berg-jarvisalo.icdmw13.pdf). I performed the encoding of this NP-HARD problem implementing the HARD and SOFT clauses described in the paper and I transformed the correlation matrix into boolean constraints to obtain a Maximum SATisfiability resulting clustering. After obtaining the OPTIMAL resulting clustering it is very easy to extract from the model which SOFT clauses are violated. As the paper explains, the performance achieved by SAT Solvers to solve this task is much higher than its analogous using Integer programming, which can be prohibitive for even a relative small amount of points.
